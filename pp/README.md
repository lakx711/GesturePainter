# AirDraw: Hand Gesture Drawing App

Welcome to AirDraw! This project lets you draw, erase, and switch colors in real-time using only your hand gestures and a webcam. No mouse or touchscreen needed—just your hand and your creativity!

## What You Need
- A computer with Python 3.7+
- A working webcam
- Internet connection (for installing dependencies)

---

## Step 1: Download the Project
1. **Clone or Download** this repository to your computer.
   - If using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone <your-repo-url>
     cd <project-folder>
     ```
   - Or download and extract the ZIP, then open the folder in your terminal or command prompt.

---

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
1. Make sure you are in the project directory (where `requirements.txt` is located).
2. Run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   This will install:
   - OpenCV (for video and drawing)
   - MediaPipe (for hand tracking)
   - NumPy (for image processing)

---

## Step 3: Run the App
1. In your terminal, make sure you are in the folder containing `hand_gesture_drawing_app.py`.
2. Start the app with:
   ```bash
   python hand_gesture_drawing_app.py
   ```
3. Your webcam will turn on, and a window will appear with a color toolbar at the top.

## Step 4: How to Use AirDraw
- **Drawing:**
  - Raise only your index finger. Move it in the air to draw on the screen.
- **Change Color:**
  - Raise both your index and middle fingers. Hover your index finger over a color in the toolbar at the top to select it. The selected color will be used for drawing.
- **Eraser:**
  - Select the black color (Eraser) from the toolbar. Now, drawing will erase instead of draw.
- **Save Your Drawing:**
  - Press the `S` key on your keyboard. Your artwork will be saved as a PNG file in the project folder.
- **Quit the App:**
  - Press the `Q` key to exit.

## Troubleshooting
- **Webcam not working?**
  - Make sure no other application is using the webcam.
  - Check that your webcam drivers are installed and up to date.
  - Try restarting your computer.
- **Hand not detected?**
  - Make sure your hand is visible and well-lit in front of the camera.
  - Try moving your hand slowly at first.
- **App crashes or errors?**
  - Double-check that all dependencies are installed.
  - Make sure you are running the correct Python version (3.7+).
